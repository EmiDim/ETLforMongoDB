# ETL for MongoDB
In this ETL process, data is extracted from Excel and txt files, transform and loaded into MongoDB. Whole process is done using Python script.  To apply separation of the ETL process steps, whole code is separated is three scrips: ExtractScript.py, TransformScript.py and LoadScript.py. Additional scripts as CommonFuncScript.py contains common functions that can be used by any of these three scripts and ReportScript.py contains functions for report generation.
